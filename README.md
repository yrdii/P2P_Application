# P2P-Application

This is a group project for course coe768, network system. 

# Introduction

This P2P project creates a system with an index server and multiple peers facilitating seamless content exchange through socket-to-socket connections. Sockets, essential for network communication, enable the establishment of communication channels like TCP and UDP between peers and the index server. UDP is favored for low latency and minimal connection requirements, while TCP ensures reliability and security through message acknowledgments. grasping these components enhances understanding of the application's functionality.
